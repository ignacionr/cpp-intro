### Section 4: Understanding Build Systems and Compilers

In this section, we'll delve into the world of build systems and compilers, essential tools for any C++ developer. We'll explore popular build systems like CMake and Make, and understand the compilation and linking process.

#### Introduction to Build Systems:
- **CMake**: Learn about CMake, a cross-platform build system that automates the build process.
- **Make**: Understand Make, a build automation tool that reads `Makefile`s to build programs.

#### Understanding Compilation and Linking Process:
- **Compilation**: Explore how the compiler translates C++ code into machine code.
- **Linking**: Understand how the linker combines object files and libraries to create an executable.

#### Writing a Basic CMake Configuration File:
1. **Create a CMake File**: Create a file named `CMakeLists.txt`.
2. **Set Minimum Version**: Define the minimum required version of CMake using `cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)`.
3. **Project Name**: Set the project name using `project(HelloWorld)`.
4. **Add Executable**: Define the executable and its source files using `add_executable(HelloWorld hello.cpp)`.

#### Example CMake Configuration File:
```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(HelloWorld)
add_executable(HelloWorld hello.cpp)
```

#### Practice Exercises:
- **Create a CMake Project**: Write a CMake configuration file for a simple project.
- **Compile with Different Compilers**: Experiment with compiling the project using different compilers like GCC and Clang.
