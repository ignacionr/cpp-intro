# Introduction to C++ Programming

## Brief History of C++
C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language. It was first released in 1985 and has since become one of the most widely used programming languages in the world.

## Overview of Modern C++ Features
Modern C++ (C++11 and later) introduced many new features that make the language more powerful, expressive, and user-friendly. Some key features include:
- Auto type deduction
- Smart pointers
- Range-based for loops
- Lambda expressions
- Concurrent programming support

## Applications and Importance of C++
C++ is known for its performance and efficiency, making it a popular choice for system programming, game development, embedded systems, and more. It is also used in various industries, including finance, healthcare, and automotive.
